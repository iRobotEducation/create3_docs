# iRobot® Create® 3 Hookup Guide

The iRobot® Create® 3 has a USB-C®[^1] connector implementing a USB 2.0 host capable of 5 V @ 3 A continuous, which can be used to power and communicate with various downstream devices.
Here are some hookup examples.

## NavQ+ by NXP
NavQ+ is an open source reference design provided by NXP and manufacturable by anyone.
Since NavQ+ has USB-C® ports capable of being configured as a USB Ethernet Gadget, a cable with a USB-C® connector on both ends is all that is required.

!!! note
    - Unless set otherwise, the default USB-C® port for use as an Ethernet Gadget device is configured to only the centermost (USB 2) USB-C® as shown in the example pictures.

The NavQ+ is pictured in the cargo bay using the 3D-printed adapter plate and on top of the faceplate using the 3D-printed case.

### Printable Case
The NavQ+ has a printable case specifically designed for use with the Create® 3, allowing for it to be mounted to the faceplate or cargo bay.
The base of the case attaches to the NavQ+ using the existing four (4) M2.5-0.45 x 12mm System On Module (SOM) mounting screws.

!!! note
    - This case is designed to be fastened together with four (4) M3-0.5 x 10mm screws if not mounted to a Create® 3 plate or M3-0.5 x 12mm if mounted; cap head is suggested.
    - For best results, it is suggested to tap/thread the M3-0.5 (Create® 3 mounting/case fastening) and M2.5-0.45 (SOM) holes.

### Printable Adapter
If a more minimal mount is desired instead of a case, an adapter plate using the existing SOM mounting screws for fastening is also provided.

!!! note
    - This adapter is designed to be fastened to the Create® 3 plate with four (4) M3-0.5 x 6mm screws; cap head is suggested.
    - For best results, it is suggested to tap/thread the M3-0.5 (Create® 3 mounting) and M2.5-0.45 (SOM) holes.
