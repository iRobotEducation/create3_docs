# iRobot® Create® 3 Releases

## Overview
Create® 3 releases take the version schema

<ROS 2 letter\>.<major number\>.<minor number\>

The letter corresponds with the ROS 2[^1] Release.
For example, G corresponds with Galactic, and H corresponds with Humble.
See [ROS 2 Releases](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases.html).

The first number corresponds with a major release number within the ROS 2 letter release.
Increments to major release imply API breaking changes or significant new features.

The second number corresponds with a minor release number within the major release number.
Increments to the minor release imply bug fixes or small feature additions that should be backwards compatible with code that currently integrates with the major release number.
One exception is that beta features may be added in minor releases.
