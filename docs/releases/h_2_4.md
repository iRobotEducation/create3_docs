## Release Overview

See below for details.

## Changelog (from H.2.3)
### Core Robot
* Webserver
    * Add [beta feature](../../webserver/forget-wifi/) to disconnect from `wlan0` and forget the SSID [(#110)](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/issues/110)
* Power Management
    * Robot will now change its light ring to "spinning red" when the battery level dips below 3%, and will explicitly call the `/robot_power` service when it falls below 2%.

### ROS 2
* Actions
    * The `/rotate_angle` action no longer accepts overriding goals; an ongoing goal must be completed (successfully or unsuccessfully) before a new goal will be accepted. [(#351)](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/issues/351)
    * Improve reliability of robot docking and undocking.
