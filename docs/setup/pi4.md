# How to Connect Create® 3 to Raspberry Pi® 4 and set up ROS 2 Galactic

## Before you start
!!! attention
    **These directions are written for someone with experience with embedded Linux and basic embedded computers.**
It is highly recommended to read through the following documents before beginning:

* [How to install Ubuntu Server on your Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi)[^1] - official Canonical documentation
* [Installing ROS 2 on Ubuntu Linux](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)[^1] - official Open Robotics documentation

## Step-by-step

1. Download [Ubuntu® Server 20.04 64-bit](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview)[^1] and write onto a microSD card.
1. In the system-boot partition, edit usercfg.txt and add `dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral`. For convenience, [here's a copy of this file](data/usercfg.txt).
1. In the system-boot partition, edit cmdline.txt to add `modules-load=dwc2,g_ether` after `rootwait`. For convenience, [here's a copy of this file](data/cmdline.txt).
1. In the system-boot partition, edit network-config to optionally add information about your Wi-Fi connection, and also add the following under `ethernets`

                usb0:
                    dhcp4: false
                    optional: true
                    addresses: [192.168.186.3/24]

    For convenience, [here's a copy of this file](data/network-config.txt). Be sure to remove the `.txt` extension.
    Note that the robot uses the default IP address of 192.168.186.2 on its usb0 interface.
    Please note also that after initial boot, editing `network-config` in the boot partition will not do anything; instead, the file to edit can be found at `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`.

1. If you would like your Raspberry Pi® 4[^3] to communicate with the Create® 3 over its USB-C®[^2] port (and not just to power it), be sure that the [USB/BLE toggle on the robot's adapter board](../../hw/electrical/#adapter-board-overview) is set to the USB position.
1. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi® 4[^3], and then use a USB-C®[^2] to USB-C®[^2] cable to connect the Raspberry Pi® 4[^3] to the Create® 3.
A photo of this connection can be found [here](../../hw/hookup/#raspberry-pi-4).
The first boot may take a few minutes. (It may help to have a monitor and keyboard set up in case of any trouble on the first boot.)

1. Log in with the default username and password (ubuntu/ubuntu), change your password, and then change your locale to be one that uses UTF-8. For example, in the US, type

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install locales
        sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
        sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
        export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

1. Then, execute the following blocks of commands to install ROS 2[^4]:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl gnupg2 lsb-release build-essential git cmake
then

        sudo curl -ksSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key  -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
        echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ros-galactic-ros-base python3-colcon-common-extensions python3-rosdep ros-galactic-rmw-fastrtps-cpp ros-galactic-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp ros-galactic-irobot-create-msgs
finally

        echo "source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
        echo "export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/galactic/" >> ~/.bashrc
        echo "source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
        echo "source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

1. At this point, we recommend setting your default RMW. The RMW you set here has to match the RMW on your robot, which can be found from its Application Configuration page. More detail on RMW can be found [here](../xml-config). Right now, the Create® 3 robot supports `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` and `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`. The default for Galactic is `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`. Depending on your robot's RMW implementation, type one of the following:

        echo "export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp" >> ~/.bashrc
or

        echo "export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp" >> ~/.bashrc

1. Log out and log back in. Once you do, test things out with a `ros2 topic list`.
A full Create® 3 API description can be found [here](../../api/ros2).

    !!! attention
        **If you are using CycloneDDS (Galactic default), your Raspberry Pi® may be running with multiple network interfaces (usb0 to talk to robot and wlan0 to talk to laptop).**
        **You will need to export a path on the Raspberry Pi® to an xml config file that registers those interfaces in the CYCLONEDDS_URI.**
        **See [CycloneDDS Multiple Network Interfaces](../xml-config/#cyclonedds).**
