## Coding The First Project - Python Web Playground
Important Note: If running multiple Create® robots, complete all of the steps below for one robot at a time to avoid connection errors.
### You’ll Need:
* Home Base® Charging Dock
* Charging Dock Cable
* Create® 3 Educational Robot
* Computer with Bluetooth™ Compatibility (i.e. [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/))

### Step 1
Confirm that your computer’s Bluetooth™ setting is [“on.”](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-bluetooth-on-or-off-in-windows-9e92fddd-4e12-e32b-9132-5e36bdb2f75a)

### Step 2
Power on your robot. Wait for your robot to fully boot up and play its “Happy Sound” before proceeding.

### Step 3
Confirm that your robot is in Bluetooth Mode. You can check this by looking for a blue light glowing through the faceplate on the back-right side of your robot. If no blue light is glowing, remove the faceplate and manually set the switch on the Adaptor Board to the Bluetooth logo on the right.

### Step 4
Open Google Chrome in a new window and navigate to [python.irobot.com](http://python.irobot.com/).

### Step 5
Click on the Connect button to open the Google Chrome Bluetooth manager. Your robot should appear in the device menu after ~30 seconds under its default device name, or as “Unsupported Device.” Select the robot’s name and click the Pair button.

### Step 6
Press play to run the example code project. Try pressing your robot’s bumpers. When you press on the right side of the bumper, your robot’s Ring Light should glow yellow and the robot should begin to spin clockwise. What happens when you press on the left side?

### Step 7
Congratulations, you have run your first python web program! To go further, explore our example code snippets and the Python Web Playground glossary to learn more about all of the available commands. Happy Coding!
