The request of a position control or autonomous behavior goal will block the execution of the <code>cmd_vel</code> messages, which will be ignored until the goal terminates.

For example, if multiple functions are decorated as \"@event(robot.when_play),\" then whenever \"robot.play()\" is written in the script, it will trigger all functions with that event tag. In functions used with events, you must use \"async\" due to the nonparallel nature. This is telling the script that we don't necessarily want to run that function right now. We want to call it when we want all the events to happen together, not in a partiuclar order. In other words, it is \"asyncronous.\" Because of this, we don't use return values with event functions. Since all the event functions happen at the same time, we would never care to use the return value of one of them.</p> <p>Whenever you want a function to be decorated by @event, you must use async in front of def. Since we want to run these functions when the event tag is called, it is an asynchronous function, thus never running when we get to it in the script. For example: <pre><code>@event(robot.when_play)\n    async def move(robot):\n\n@event(robot.when_play)\n    async def color(robot):\n\nrobot.play()\n</code></pre> The <code>robot.play()</code> line starts the robot's event system. It triggers all the functions decorated with @event(robot.when_play). Additionally, it will listen for other events like the ones associated with sensors. See max_obstacles.py, instrument.py, or bumper_control.py for full example. Each function that is triggered will run \"in parallel,\" meaning they will all run at the same time. Normally, python scripts will run each function in the order that it reads. The events allow us to run functions at the same time or out of order, instead of one by one.</p> <p>Since the robot uses a few different sensors, now we can take advantage of all of them at once. We don't have to wait to run the bumpers if we are using the IR sensors.</p> <p>We can use the normal \"def\" format if we want to run that function to access its return value later. See max_obstacles.py as an example.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/pwp/cheat-sheets/#async","title":"Async","text":"<p>Async functions can suspend their execution before reaching return, and move to run a different function in that time. You can use async with or without an event decorator. This is when you have a function that you don't want to run immediately in the script (such as the normal \"def\" function) or if you want to run when the event is called. Async is used with a function that is called later, usually in an event function. Async functions can have return values. If you want to run a function where it is in the script, use def. If you want it to run asynchronously and run when you call it, used async def. If you use methods, put an \"await\" in front. \"Await\" can only be used in an async def function. For example: <pre><code>async def forward(robot):\n  await robot.set_wheel_speeds(speed, speed)\n\nasync def sensors(robot):\n  sensors = (await robot.get_ir_proximity()).sensors\n  avg = sum(sensors)/len(sensors)\n  return avg\n\n@event(robot.when_play)\nasync def play(robot):\n  await forward(robot)\n\nrobot.play()\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"lessons/pwp/cheat-sheets/#class","title":"Class","text":"<p>Class: A function in a class is called a method.

This parameter controls the amount of time that the robot will keep executing the last provided velocity command (on the <code>/cmd_vel</code> topic) before considering it stale and stopping the wheels. Default value is 0.5 seconds.</li> <li> <p>Add the following ROS 2 parameters to the <code>/robot_state</code> node to control (and disable) unnecessary ROS 2 publications to improve robot performance:</p> <ul> <li><code>publish_hazard_msgs</code>: default <code>true</code>. If set to false, the robot will not publish the <code>/hazard_detection</code> topic. Disabling this can noticeably reduce the CPU and RAM usage of the robot.</li> <li><code>hazards_pub_fixed_period_ms</code>: default <code>-1</code>. This controls whether the robot should publish hazard information even if the hazards are not changing. Set it to <code>-1</code> to disable fixed period hazard publications and have hazards be published only when they change. This parameter will be ignored if <code>publish_hazard_msgs</code> is set to <code>false</code>.</li> <li><code>raw_kinematics_min_pub_period_ms</code>: default <code>25</code>. This controls the minimum period at which the robot should publish raw kinematics information. If set to <code>-1</code>, it will disable raw kinematics publications. This can noticeably reduce the CPU and RAM usage of the robot. A value of <code>1</code> indicates that raw data should be published as soon as they are available. Values higher than <code>1</code> will throttle publications and will give some CPU improvement, but won't help RAM usage. The following topics are affected by this parameter: <code>/imu</code>, <code>/mouse</code>, <code>/wheel_status</code>, <code>/wheel_ticks</code>,  <code>/wheel_vels</code>. If you are not interested in subscribing to these topics, it's recommended to set this parameter's value to <code>-1</code>.</li> <li><code>publish_odom_tfs</code>: default <code>true</code>. If set to false, the robot will not publish odometry information in the <code>/tf</code> topic. This can reduce the CPU and RAM usage of the robot if not needed. Note: this parameter is independent from <code>raw_kinematics_min_pub_period_ms</code></li> </ul> <p>As a summary, the best performance can be obtained via <pre><code>robot_state:\n  ros__parameters:\n    publish_hazard_msgs: false\n    publish_odom_tfs: false\n    raw_kinematics_min_pub_period_ms: -1\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that <code>publish_odom_tfs: true</code> is required to interact with the navigation stack.</p> <p>This new version changes the default timing of some ROS 2 topics to improve the CPU performance.

If the Create\u00ae 3's Wi-Fi is connected to a network with internet connection, it will sync to a global time NTP server. The Create\u00ae 3 NTP config is also set to listen for servers on USB IP address 192.168.186.1 and 192.168.186.3. If the compute board is connected over USB to the Create\u00ae 3 with the compute board assigned one of these IP addresses on its USB interface, NTP on the compute board can keep the clocks between the compute board and Create\u00ae 3 in sync, even without an internet connection. If there is an internet connection on both compute board and Create\u00ae 3, configuring the NTP server on the compute board to serve the Create\u00ae 3 can still add value by reducing jitter between clocks.

Different solutions are presented, as each is suitable for different scenarios.</p>"},{"location":"setup/multi-robot/#ros-2-namespaces","title":"ROS 2 Namespaces","text":"<p>The easiest way to prevent multiple ROS 2 processes from communicating with each other is to use ROS 2 namespaces. As you may know, each ROS 2 entity is uniquely identified by its name (for example the topic named <code>cmd_vel</code> is used to control the robot). By specifying a namespace for a ROS 2 process you are effectively pre-pending a word in front of the name of all the entities created by it.</p> <p>The ROS 2 namespace can be set from the Application \u2192 Configuration menu in the Create\u00ae 3 robot's web server. Note that the namespace name must start with a slash <code>/</code>.</p> <p>If you have two robots and you specify the following namespaces: <code>/robot_1</code> and <code>/robot_2</code> you will then be able to see their individual topics well-separated:</p> <pre><code>$ ros2 topic list\n/robot_1/cmd_vel\n/robot_1/dock\n/robot_1/odom\n...\n/robot_2/cmd_vel\n/robot_2/dock\n/robot_2/odom\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Note that if you want to publish or subscribe to a specific topic, now you have to prepend the appropriate namespace in front of it. For example:</p> <pre><code>$ ros2 topic echo /robot_1/odom\n</code></pre> <p>Using a custom ROS 2 namespace for your robots is the recommended solution if you don't have too many robots or if you have an additional application that needs to communicate with all of them at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"setup/multi-robot/#ros-2-domain-ids","title":"ROS 2 Domain IDs","text":"<p>A different approach for isolating multiple ROS 2 processes consists in specifying the <code>ROS_DOMAIN_ID</code> environment variable.</p> <p>If two processes use a different <code>ROS_DOMAIN_ID</code> value they will be completely isolated from each other, which means that they will not only avoid communication, but they also will not be able to discover each other.
